# __**Changelog**__

# **4.1**
4.1.0 (May 1, 2025) - idk made parameters light blue or something

# **4.0**
4.0.0 (Mar. 9, 2025) - Uhh remade the whole thing based on "One Dark Darker" lol.

# **3.2**
3.2.1 (Aug. 5, 2023) - Changed token `string.quoted.single.tsx` from the default lime string color to a yellower color, since most of the time these strings will be used alongside jsx tags, which are pink and have red attributes - gold fits better in that context. This comes at the cost of every string inside of .tsx and .jsx files being this bright yellow color.

3.2.0 (Aug. 5, 2023) - Some theme name tweaks and description changes. Colors-wise: HTML and JSON files now utilize a magenta color for tags and property names. Overall highlighting gradient shifted from red-yellow-green to pink-red-yellow. Swapped around a lot of CSS colors to match this and also include more of the spectrum in general. Besides that, increased saturation for a few tokens in all languages.
